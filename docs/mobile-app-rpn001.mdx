### 5 Tab navigation routes
The app comprises of five bottom tab based navigation routes. `Home`, `Services`, `Chat`, `About` & `Contact`. `Home` is the first screen when
the app loads up, it consists of a main slider and a list of main branch of the services, currently it shows up main branches i.e.
`Individual` and `Business`. Next tab is of Services, it contains list of main branches and upon clicking on either one of those branches,
it will route to another screen with a list of all sub-branches categorised in that main branch. Next tab is of `Chat` feature, which will
run the computer to use based chat environment, the app will chat until the user has gone through all the pre-built chat steps and upon
completing all the setps, it will be stored on the database sent over a network call. Next tab is of `About` that shows series of block of
content explaining various aspects of the business. Last tab is of `Contact` detailing all possible options of being in contact with the
potential clients.

### Dark / Light Mode
The app supports both dark and light modes, dependeing on your mobile devices OS preferences, the application will adopt itself from those
set preferences.

### Over the Air updates for minor amends
The app supports `CodePush` feature, that supports to update the `JavaScript` layer of the application remotely, which removes the process
of application review process on both `iOS` and `Android` app stores, that could take up to days/weeks in the review process.
A word of caution, one MUST NOT ship major updates via `CodePush`. It is designed to deploy changes that are miniscule in nature, like
fixing bugs, A/B Testing or theme updates.

However, should you wish to update a major feature set, one must go through the usual steps via the app stores of either platforms.
