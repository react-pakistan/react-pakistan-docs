## Intro
Solicitors app is designed to help Solicitors/Lawyers/Attorney based businesses to market their services to the world or selective regions.
Following are standard features of the current app implementation:

- 5 Tab navigation routes
- Dark / Light Mode
- Over the Air App updates for minor amends
- Auto chat feature with 1000's of users at the same time
- Developer's Friendly codebase
- Super clean code
- Tested codebase
- TypeScript over JavaScript
- Theme Support
- Kept all data at parent level

### 5 Tab navigation routes
The app comprises of five bottom tab based navigation routes. `Home`, `Services`, `Chat`, `About` & `Contact`. `Home` is the first screen when
the app loads up, it consists of a main slider and a list of main branch of the services, currently it shows up main branches i.e.
`Individual` and `Business`. Next tab is of Services, it contains list of main branches and upon clicking on either one of those branches,
it will route to another screen with a list of all sub-branches categorised in that main branch. Next tab is of `Chat` feature, which will
run the computer to use based chat environment, the app will chat until the user has gone through all the pre-built chat steps and upon
completing all the setps, it will be stored on the database sent over a network call. Next tab is of `About` that shows series of block of
content explaining various aspects of the business. Last tab is of `Contact` detailing all possible options of being in contact with the
potential clients.

### Dark / Light Mode
The app supports both dark and light modes, dependeing on your mobile devices OS preferences, the application will adopt itself from those
set preferences.

### Over the Air updates for minor amends
The app supports `CodePush` feature, that supports to update the `JavaScript` layer of the application remotely, which removes the process
of application review process on both `iOS` and `Android` app stores, that could take up to days/weeks in the review process.
A word of caution, one MUST NOT ship major updates via `CodePush`. It is designed to deploy changes that are miniscule in nature, like
fixing bugs, A/B Testing or theme updates.

However, should you wish to update a major feature set, one must go through the usual steps via the app stores of either platforms.

### Auto Chat Feature
This app supports auto chat feature with 1000's of users at the same time and collecting their shared conversational data to make
important business decisions on it. For instance, we have added a chat feature in this application to capture user's detail so a
solicitors/layers/attorneys firm can make better decisions on it. The chat data is collected when it is ended and saved over on a 
Firebase RealTime Database services.

### Developer's Friendly codebase
We have kept the codebase developer's friendly as much as possible. However, a detailed explanation of the codebase structure is 
outlined in the main docs area, where you will find how the code breakdown and other important decisions are made in building up
this application.

### Super clean code
We believe that super clean code is the way to code robust, maintainable and production applications. In order to achieve that
we adopted some of the best industry standard guidelines and practices to enforce super clean code for the community.

### Tested codebase
We have introduced unit and snapshot testing of most of the components, in order to quality control our written pieces of codebase,
however though, we aim to increase our coverage and other strategies of testing codebase in the future.

### TypeScript over JavaScript
All maintainable `JavaScript` codebase have switched to `TypeScript` due to some of the features that comes inheritly with `TypeScript`.
StackOverflow's last year trend has clearly shown a visibile increment in adoption of `TypeScript` in the last few years, thus making
it clear what might the future hold for this space. We used `TypeScript` in order to keep robust and bug free codebase which otherwise
with `JavaScript` is too cumbersome to achieve.

### Theme Support
A theme has been wired across all units of the app, that has all the application theming context information wrapped within a `JavaScript`
object. This essentially enables to standarise the usage of certain elements, like spacing strategy, app used colors, typography, borders
etc. If is super easy to add/update either of these values as per your requirements, globally - that should reflect all over your 
application.
